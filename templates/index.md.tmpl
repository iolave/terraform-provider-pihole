# Pi-hole Provider

The [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) provider is used to manage Pi-hole resources. The provider should be configured with the Pi-hole URL and the admin password (not the hashed web password).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

This is a fork of [ryanwholey/terraform-provider-pihole](https://github.com/ryanwholey/terraform-provider-pihole) and it uses the modern `/api` format instead of the `/admin/api.php` one (if you require the old format, please use [ryanwholey/pihole](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ryanwholey/pihole/latest/docs) provider until both versions are supported within this provider).

See the full changelog [here](https://github.com/iolave/terraform-provider-pihole/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Example Usage

### Basic

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

**Note**: Authenticating via `api_token` is currently experimental and requires a Pi-hole Web Interface version of `>= 5.11.0` (see [release notes](https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/releases/tag/v5.11)). The Pi-hole API has just recently began supporting API token authentication for specific resources. Currently the following resources are manageable via API token:

- `pihole_cname_record`
- `pihole_dns_record`

### Dynamic Provider

In the case that Pi-hole is deployed in the same root module that the provider is to be used, a `null_resource` can be used to wait for the server to become ready.
